FrogWild!
=========

Joint work with Michael Borokhovich, Alex Dimakis and Constantine Caramanis.

Our latest project on approximating PageRank on graph engines. Using random walks and a simple modification of the GraphLab egine, we manage to get a 7x improvement compared to the state of the art.

We complement our experiments with theoretical guarantees on the quality of the achieved solution.

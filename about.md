In my website you will find some things I have come to understand 
-- by spending a ridiculous amount of time on them -- and many more that confound me. Math, music, programming, photography and high-performance computing are things I know a tiny bit about and strive to learn more.



## Research Interests
Machine Learning, High Dimensional Statistics, Large-scale Distributed Computation.

My work is motivated by the goal of making modern machine learning and data analysis accessible to non-experts and organizations with limited resources. Achieving this goal requires a number of theoretical and systems advances that will keep producing interesting research questions for years to come:
fast and resource-efficient algorithms,
self-tuning methods,
data-dependent guarantees
and distributed, large-scale computation 
are all necessary for a simple to use, automated ML pipeline. 

My favorite problems span the intersection of theory and systems.
Our recent work on <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/asynchrony/">asynchronous optimization</a> identifies a previously unknown connection between optimization and system dynamics, with important implications for the setup and tuning of large-scale learning systems.
More recently, I have been working on producing a self-tuning optimization algorithm for deep learning.
I also work on inference, trying to understand the importance of and optimize the scan order used in Gibbs sampling.

In the past, I have worked on resource-limited problems like memory-limited streaming PCA as well as streaming PCA with overwhelming erasures in the entries of each sample.
I have also worked on approximate but fast solutions for large-scale graph problems, like PageRank and finding dense subgraphs.
Throughout our work I strive to bring together our very real implementation and the theory that will guarantee we get a good result.

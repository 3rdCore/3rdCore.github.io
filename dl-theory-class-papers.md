IFT6085: Class bibliography
=========

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of recent papers that include theoretical or theory-driven work
that applies on deep learning.
We will draw from this list for the seminar section of the class,
including student paper presentations.
Students are welcome to suggest other papers that they like as long as they
are relevant to the class.

Note: some of these results are not given in a deep learning setting, however the ideas 
and techniques there are very useful for our exploration in class.

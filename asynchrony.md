Asynchrony begets Momentum
=========

In a recent [note](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09774), we show that
when asynchrony in SGD, introduces an extra momentum term. 
In the companion [systems paper](http://bit.ly/ovore), we use this
theory to understand statistical efficiency and train deep networks
faster.
